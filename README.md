# Pro-README-Generator
This project is made for professionals to generate an impressive README for your portfolio, built by a professional. README files can be added to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

To create the read me file generator I implemented my knowledge of Node JS and use of the inquirer package, objects and array methods.
